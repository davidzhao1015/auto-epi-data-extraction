Task: Extract the following data items related to Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome (CMS) from the uploaded document. Ensure accuracy and completeness. Use “NR” (Not Reported) if the information is not explicitly reported, or “multiple studies analysis” if derived from a systematic review or meta-analysis.

Patient Counts
	1.	Total patient number: Total number of patients in the study, regardless of CMS subtype.
	2.	Subtype-specific patient numbers: For each of the four predefined gene-related subtypes (DOK7, AGRN, LRP4, MuSK), provide:
        •	Subtype (gene name)
        •	Patient number
	3.	Subtype proportions: Proportion of each predefined subtype within the cohort. Provide:
        •	Subtype (gene name)
        •	Proportion

Incidence Metrics
	4.	Incidence denominator
	5.	Total incidence
	6.	Total incidence standard deviation
	7.	Total incidence confidence interval – lower bound
	8.	Total incidence confidence interval – upper bound
	9.	Subtype-specific incidence: For each of DOK7, AGRN, LRP4, and MuSK, provide:
        •	Subtype (gene name)
        •	Incidence
        •	Incidence standard deviation
        •	Confidence interval – lower bound
        •	Confidence interval – upper bound

Prevalence Metrics
	10.	Total prevalence
	11.	Total prevalence standard deviation
	12.	Total prevalence confidence interval – lower bound
	13.	Total prevalence confidence interval – upper bound
	14.	Subtype-specific prevalence: For each of DOK7, AGRN, LRP4, and MuSK, provide:
        •	Subtype (gene name)
        •	Prevalence
        •	Prevalence standard deviation
        •	Confidence interval – lower bound
        •	Confidence interval – upper bound
